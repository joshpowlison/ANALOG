TO DO:
	- Add analog stick support
	- Make dots and such actually draw a line
	- Make player and target dots have depth, so they layer over each other
	- 

NEXT STEPS:
	- Make draw lines
	- Make lines cross each other
	- When the player starts, set it up so that we can confirm they have a joystick-supporting gamepad connected and set the deadzone when they press A (or another button)
	- Make analog stick flick back if using touch or mouse?
	- Make Git repo public (if it isn't already)
	- Put up on website page


- Problems I'm trying to solve:
	- Read analog stick input from a gamepad
	- Split input position data off from mouse (so that we could use gamepad)
























IDEAS:
	SupremeCookie
		- Scoring with images (like theme part, rubber ducky, etc)
		- Rotate window when imperfect
		- Screen shake
		- Move the analog stick on-screen
	Brandon
		- Make outside of dot solid, but inside fades out?\
	Stefon
		- Colorblind mode(?)
		- Playing with different hand modes
		- Text on different scores
